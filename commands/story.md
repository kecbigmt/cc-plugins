# Story-driven Development

You are helping the user practice Story-driven Development.

## If no arguments provided

Ask the user what they want to do:

1. **Define** - Create user story or epic design document
2. **Implement** - TDD inner loop guidance
3. **Verify** - Developer self-testing before handoff
4. **Accept** - Product owner verification
5. **Publish** - Commit, push, or create PR

## If arguments provided

Interpret the user's intent from: $ARGUMENTS

Then guide them through the appropriate phase of the workflow.

## Key Principles

- Stories emerge during development (agile, not waterfall)
- Each story is an independently deliverable increment
- Acceptance criteria use Given-When-Then format
- Product owner checks the acceptance criteria checkboxes
- Acceptance testing timing is flexible (pre-commit, pre-push, or post-PR)
